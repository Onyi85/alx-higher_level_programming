#  Python - Inheritance
Inheritance means creating a child class from the parent. Hence, you've created the child class from the parent, you then have the ability to use all the methods and attributes from the parent and you also have the functionality to override a method or attribute from the parents.

Inheritance is represented using the Unified Modeling Language or UML in the following way:

Classes are represented as boxes with the class name on top. The inheritance relationship is represented by an arrow from the derived class pointing to the base class. The word extends is usually added to the arrow.

Note: In an inheritance relationship:

- Classes that inherit from another are called derived classes, subclasses, or subtypes.
- Classes from which other classes are derived are called base classes or super classes.

- A derived class is said to derive, inherit, or extend a base class.
# Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

# General
- Why Python programming is awesome
- What is a superclass, baseclass or parentclass
- What is a subclass
- How to list all attributes and methods of a class or instance
- When can an instance have new attributes
- How to inherit class from another
- How to define a class with multiple base classes
- What is the default class every class inherit from
- How to override a method or attribute inherited from the base class
- Which attributes or methods are available by heritage to subclasses
- What is the purpose of inheritance
- What are, when and how to use isinstance, issubclass, type and super built-in functions
